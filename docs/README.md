# Audiences

"Audiences" is a SCIM-integrated notifier for real-time Rails actions based on group changes.

## Installation

1. Follow the [installation instructions](../audiences/docs/README.md#installation) for the audiences gem.
1. Follow the [installation instructions](../audiences-react/docs/README.md#installation) for the `@powerhome/audiences` package for react.

## How does it work

1. User creates a criteria based on SCIM groups;
1. Whenever the group of users matching this criteria changes, a notification is posted to `Audiences::Notifications`;
1. The rails app can react to this change (i.e.: granting or revoking memberships).
